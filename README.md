# London Weather analysis
Climate Insights Ltd. is working to improve weather-related predictions and
analysis in London, UK. The company aims to provide better insights for local
businesses, especially those dependent on weather conditions. To achieve
this, XYZ Climate Insights Ltd. has provided data captured in the
"London_Weather.csv" dataset.


Using the provided dataset, you are required to complete the following tasks:
1. Load the "London_Weather.csv" dataset in a Python-compatible
environment.
2. Identify any missing features in the dataset and suggest additions or
comment on superfluous ones.
3. Analyze the dataset's dimensionality to determine its suitability for the
study.
4. Perform exploratory data analysis and preprocess the data.
5. Present the results of Task 4 using appropriate visualizations.
6. Determine the key variables that influence weather patterns in London.
7. Select an appropriate machine learning approach to model and predict
outcomes based on the data. Justify your choice.
8. Identify a suitable performance metric for this problem and explain your
reasoning.


## Overview
The London Weather Analysis Assignment is designed to predict weather types based on pre-recorded weather data values. This assignment utilized a machine learnign model to classify the weather into its correct categories.


## Features
- Input Parameters: This code uses a variety of weather-related data such as Date, Precipitation, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, and Wind Speed.
- Prediction: Based on the input features, the machine learning model classifies the weather into its own category, for instance: Sunny, Heavy Rain, Snow, Light Rain, Fog.

- Data Exploration: The dataset includes outliers and a range of values.

## Technologies Used
-	Backend: Python.
-	Data Handling: pandas, numpy.
-	Data Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib.

## Dataset
This assignment is provided with the weather data set that will be fed into the machine learning algorithm. The dataset includes:
-	date: The date of when the data was recorded.
-	precipitation: Decimal values representing the precipitation.
-	temp_max: Decimal values presenting the maximum temperature.
-	temp_min: Decimal values presenting the minimum temperature.
-	wind: Decimal values representing wind speed.
-	weather: Categorical target variable for classification.
